					<p>
						Contrary to common opinion, only programmers and computer science students are eligible to apply. Everyone is invited to join WeHack, from middle school age to those looking for additional experience. WeHack is searching for participants with innovative and creative ideas that will impact society, not just those who know how to code.

				<div class="question">
					<h3>Is it possible for a team to have members from both middle and high schools?</h3>

				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Absolutely yes! If a team has two members in high school or above, this team will be considered a high school group. Even if a team only has one member from high school, it will be counted as a middle school team.

				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Don't worry. There will be a question in the application form where you may pick whether you want to join alone, with a team, or without a team. If you'd like to join a team but don't have one yet, we'll be the ones "searching" for good teammates for you!
